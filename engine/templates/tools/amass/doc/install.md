[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/amass.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/amass/versions)

## Prebuilt Binaries

A [precompiled version is available](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass/releases) with each release.

## Using Docker

1. Build the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) image:

```bash
docker build -t amass https://github.com/OWASP/Amass.git
```

2. Run the Docker image:

```bash
docker run -v OUTPUT_DIR_PATH:/.config/amass/ amass enum --list
```

The volume argument allows the Amass graph database to persist between executions and output files to be accessed on the host system. The first field (left of the colon) of the volume option is the amass output directory that is external to Docker, while the second field is the path, internal to Docker, where amass will write the output files.

The wordlists maintained in the Amass git repository are available in `/examples/wordlists/` within the docker container. For example, to use `all.txt`:

```bash
docker run -v OUTPUT_DIR_PATH:/.config/amass/ amass enum -brute -w /wordlists/all.txt -d example.com
```

## From Source

If you prefer to build your own binary from the latest release of the source code, make sure you have a correctly configured **Go >= 1.14** environment. More information about how to achieve this can be found [on the golang website.](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Simply execute the following commands:

1. Add the Go Module environment variable:

```bash
export GO111MODULE=on
```

2. Download OWASP Amass:

```bash
go get -v github.com/OWASP/Amass/cmd/amass
```
Or:
```bash
go get -v github.com/OWASP/Amass/v3/...
```

At this point, the binary should be in *$GOPATH/bin*.

3. If you'd like to rebuild the binary from the project source code:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/OWASP/Amass

go install ./...
```

Several wordlists for performing DNS name alterations and brute forcing can be found in the following directory:

```bash
ls $GOPATH/src/github.com/OWASP/Amass/examples/wordlists/
```
